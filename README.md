# Ship Management System (Java)

This project models different types of ships using **object-oriented programming** principles in Java. It demonstrates **inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces** through a hierarchy of classes.

---

## Files Included
- **Ship.java** → Base class with common ship attributes (name, year built).  
- **CargoShip.java** → Subclass of `Ship`, representing cargo ships with capacity attributes.  
- **CruiseShip.java** → Subclass of `Ship`, representing cruise ships with passenger capacity.  
- **Displayable.java** → Interface enforcing a `display()` method for consistent output.  
- **shipDemo.java** → Driver class to create and manage different ship objects.  

---

## Features
- Demonstrates **inheritance** through `Ship` subclasses.  
- Applies **polymorphism** to handle multiple ship types in one program.  
- Uses an **interface (`Displayable`)** for consistent data display.  
- Console-based program to showcase ship details.
